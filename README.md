# Should I Stay or Should I Go?

## Problem
Since the coronavirus pandemic started, everyone is trying to take some measurements to keep their selves and the people around them safe. One of the most common measurement is maintaining a social distance with other people. 
To maintain this social distancing policy, lots of businesses got closed for some amount of time. 

However, as the spread of the virus is slowed down, some of the businesses are starting to re-open.
Even though the businesses are re-opening, there are lots of questions in the minds of the customers, 
such as, how many people are there now, can I maintain my social this distance there, is the place clean,
the biggest question is, Should I Stay or Should I go?

## Solution
To provide a solution to this problem, I created Should I Stay or Should I Go which is a web application for users and a desktop application for the clients.

By using the web application, users can see the number of people who are currently in a registered location, and also they can see the total number of people who visited that location on that day. 

Other than this, businesses can set an upper limit of the number of people that they can allow inside, and by using this number, 
users can decide whether to go or not to go to that location. This creates a huge benefit for the businesses as well, because since customers know whether or not the location is available, they don't cause a demand that the businesses cannot provide.
